# FPM
This is Matlab simulation to provide the proof of concept for Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM). 

Input : cameraman image

Multiple(9) low resolution images are generated by masking the spectrum of the cameraman image and then a high resolution image is generated by stitching these images in the Fourier domain which has exactly double resolution than low resolution image which generated when the mask was at the center of the spectrum.  

The number of masks, radius of the mask and the number of iterations of the complete algorithm can be 
changed accordingly.
